To the extent that the Scope of Work includes the removal of water or rectification of water damage with respect to areas that are not fully accessible by Blacksmith Construction LLC, Customer understands and acknowledges that Blacksmith Construction LLC does not represent or warrant that: (i) Blacksmith Construction LLC will accomplish removal of all moisture from such areas; or (ii) the growth of mold and/or mildew in such areas has not begun or will not later begin. To the extent the Scope of Work includes the removal or remediation of mold and/or mildew, Customer understands and acknowledges that, due to the nature of mold and mildew, Blacksmith Construction LLC does not represent or warrant that: (i) all mold and/or mildew can or will be removed; or (ii) mold and/or mildew will not recur. Customer acknowledges that completion of the Scope of Work may not constitute all necessary remedial activities and that continued or additional remedial activities may be required after completion of the Scope of Work, and that Blacksmith Construction LLC shall have no liability or responsibilities to Customer with respect to such continued or additional remedial activities.</p>
